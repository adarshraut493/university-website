Safety: a human right at the heart of our business
Health and safety is one of our eight salient human rights issues. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees as part of our Code Policy on Occupational Health & Safety which forms part of our Code of Business Principles (PDF 8.55 MB).

These safety standards are also based on mandatory requirements which align with the obligations set out in the international standard for occupational health and safety management, ISO 45001. All standards and guidelines are available to our employees on our intranet. Our Code of Business Principles is reviewed regularly, and along with our employees, we expect all others who work with us to follow the principles set out.

The Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) oversees Unilever’s conduct as a responsible business and reviews our Code of Business Principles to ensure that these remain fit for purpose. The Committee also reviews health and safety strategies and performance through a quarterly scorecard.

Our leaders are responsible for cascading and implementing occupational health and safety among their direct reports and third parties within their remit. We also expect all employees to take responsibility for their safety and those around them by acting in accordance with our Codes. In our own operations, we aim for Zero Harm, which underpins everything we do as a business.

Our work with suppliers to improve safety standards can be found in our Human Rights reports and Human rights in our value chain. If an employee is in breach of our safety standards or procedures, cases are dealt with fairly and objectively. Our consequence management policy varies between the countries in which we operate, reflecting local legislation and frameworks. We can take a range of disciplinary actions against those responsible for poor safety oversight, including dismissal in the most serious cases.
